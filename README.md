# HT_2013_2018_DataSet
Using a data set from the FBI's public releases, I took a simple look into the top Human Trafficking states and regions.

From some queries, I wanted to see the percentage of cases solved, unsolved, and reported false in the top state and US overall and made a pie chart to display it.

After looking at the number of cases and amount left unsolved since 2013, it's clear that Human Trafficking cases are primarily in Texas and other states near each border of America. It makes me wonder if you can extrapolate further in the high case regions to see if there's a higher chance of trafficking occuring in more impoverished cities or places close to ports, airfields, or other shipping routes. Are there also cases that overlap with missing persons data and vice versa? Could be something worthwhile looking into to try and join data tables to find any correlations.
